**Hey!** I'm **Baptiste Dubillaud**, a young (25 years old) software enginner. **Welcome to my blog üòÅ!**

&nbsp;

Here is what I will talk about:

- A quick presentation
- What I'm looking for

&nbsp;

## A quick presentation

I grew up in Pau, in the south of France. I studied there until I graduated with an Engineering degree from **CY-Tech** (formerly EISTI), an IT engineering school.

### Scholarship

I attended **Saint-Cricq High School** for my **Technical Baccalaur√©at**, followed by two years of **preparatory classes** (CPGE TSI).

I then enrolled at **EISTI** as a student in IT engineering, where I spent the first two years learning the fundamentals of **software engineering**. During this time, I had the opportunity to gain practical experience at TotalEnergies. In my first year, I worked on **geoscientific software** for petroleum and gas exploration, and in my second year (which replaced a semester in Vietnam cancelled due to COVID), I worked on a **water injection simulation software**.

During my final year at EISTI (renamed CY-Tech), I joined the **Big Data Analytics** (BDA) class, where I worked with Big Data technologies, **CUDA**, **OpenMP**, **MPI** for parallel computing, and **Spark** and **Pandas** for more general big data applications. I had the opportunity to apply this knowledge on **Pangea II** and **III** at TotalEnergies. Additionally, I explored the architecture of High-Performance Computers. This class was managed jointly by CY-Tech and ***La Coru√±a* University** in Spain.

### Tech stack

With only four years of experience, I have been fortunate to work with a variety of technologies on diverse projects across different industries.

**Software**: Java (Netty, Swing, JavaFX), C++/C (OpenMP, MPI), Python (FastAPI, Pandas, Dash)

**Web**: React, Next.js, Framer-Motion

**Tools**: Bash, Powershell

## What I'm looking for

I am very eager to explore and learn new technologies, but I am particularly focused on developing my skills on cloud platforms such as **Azure** and **DataBricks**.

After nearly two years in Denmark, I am seeking a new position as a Software or Data Engineer in Switzerland or France, but I am also open to opportunities in other countries.
