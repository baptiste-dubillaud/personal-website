**Hey!** I'm **Baptiste Dubillaud**, a young software enginner. **Welcome to my blog 😁!**  

&nbsp;

I built this blog to post about technologies, frameworks, or libraries I experimented with without using them in a proper project.

I also use this blog to explain some things, like the article about implementing the MSAL OAuth2 library from Microsoft to authenticate users of a website using Azure AD on a NextJS app.

I can use it to synthesize some articles I read on Medium or interesting Stack Overflow posts I found.

&nbsp;

**More articles will come soon!**

See you there! 👐
